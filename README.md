Bzcheat
=======

This was my first attempt at a cheat for a video game. I used to play a tank battle game called BZFlag on my free time and wondered 
if I could make a cheat for it. This cheat allows you to do things such as get any powerup/flag you want, kill any target instantly, 
identify flags before you pick them up, go through walls, fly in the air, etc...

# Usage

Since this is an old version, run a diff on the two directories to see how this cheat was made. It's not complicated. The knowledge
you gain could help you in creating a cheat for the newer version (for educational purposes of course).
